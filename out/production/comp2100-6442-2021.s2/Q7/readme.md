The given code realises a `Calculator` using the `FacadeDesignPattern`. The calculator can perform four basic arithmetic operations:

* `Addition`
* `Subtraction`
* `Multiplication`
* `Division`

Please refer to the test cases in `CalculatorTest.java` for more details.

You are expected to complete:
* `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()` in `Calculator.java` file
* `evaluate()` in `Division.java` file

You should call the `evaluate()` methods in the basic arithmetic operation classes to achieve `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, `divide()` for the `Calculator`. You are not allowed to directly perform computations in these functions.
